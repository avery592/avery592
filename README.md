# üó® Private Messages
You can message me privately on [SimpleX][1].

# ü™ô Tips
If you like what I do, you can easily [send Monero][4] to the following address:
`47averyEStBZhvddZqJPVPRXC9NRxT56vXwpRxSXHLrf6r4WDJdnGCbFPnqgn1noQmfLhZfgcWZiqWbgwjWoFkCLBtkq2iB`.

# ü™™ Cryptographic Identity
You can verify you're talking to me or that I wrote something (like this
document!) with SSH signatures. The following SSH fingerprint is mine, and
all my git commits are signed with it:
`SHA256:avery1FYMMQQsL00uBtkTn1yLej4kZ+M7cdttNchWeQ`.
And here is the corresponding public key file:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIC/emPms+RPqHCckMTkE7pemmV4MW3eMBMHsRwZ/pDUw
```

## ‚úíÔ∏è Signatures
To verify something was signed by me, add the following line to `~/.ssh/allowed_signers`:
```
avery@avery.st ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIC/emPms+RPqHCckMTkE7pemmV4MW3eMBMHsRwZ/pDUw
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Git Signatures
Git will now verify commit signatures, for example in my `mrr` project:
```
$ git log --show-signature
commit 215a002a33a4f1beb4a266d09231e66d1bb774f8 (HEAD -> main, origin/main)
Good "git" signature for avery@avery.st with ED25519 key SHA256:avery1FYMMQQsL00uBtkTn1yLej4kZ+M7cdttNchWeQ
Author: Avery <avery@avery.st>
Date:   Sun Apr 20 17:37:14 2025 -0500

    Implement vanity SSH key generator
```

### üìÑ File/Message Signatures
If I send you a file `message` with a corresponding signature file
`message.sig`, you can verify it as follows:
```
$ ssh-keygen -Y verify -f ~/.ssh/authorized_signers -I avery@avery.st -n file -s file.md.sig < file.md
Good "file" signature for avery@avery.st with ED25519 key SHA256:avery1FYMMQQsL00uBtkTn1yLej4kZ+M7cdttNchWeQ
```

More information about SSH signatures for arbitrary files can be found
[here][0].

## üóùÔ∏è Encryption
If you need to reach out to me privately, please contact me on [SimpleX][1],
for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. If you must contact me some other
way, like over email, you can also encrypt a message to my SSH key using a tool
like [rage][2]. If you put my public key in a file called `avery.pub` with the
following contents:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIC/emPms+RPqHCckMTkE7pemmV4MW3eMBMHsRwZ/pDUw
```

Then the following command given a file `message` encrypts the contents to a
file called `message.age` that only my private SSH key can decrypt:
```
$ rage -R avery.pub message > message.age
```

Attach `message.age` in your email to me and leave the body of your email and
the subject line empty to minimize metadata.

## ‚ùìWhy not PGP?
I've chosen to use SSH over PGP because it is widely considered secure by
cryptographers [unlike PGP][3], and has good tools for signatures in git,
making it an attractive foundation for cryptographic identity for a developer
like myself.
